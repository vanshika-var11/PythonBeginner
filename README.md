 CaesarCipher
 The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
 The number of positions each letter is shifted by is called the "shift".
 To encrypt, for each letter, find its position in the alphabet, shift it by the key, and replace it with the new letter.
 To decrypt, shift each letter in the ciphertext backward by the key to return to the original message.
